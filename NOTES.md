## Base Global Package Setup

The following NPM Packages are required for initial setup to be able to utilize and run this project:

```bash
npm i -g @angular/cli
npm i -g @nrwl/schematics
npm i -g nx
```

# Initial Setup of App and Some Libraries

The project was initially setup using this command:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace webrtc-demos
nx add @angular/material
npx ng g lib material
# Created Material Module exports
npx ng g lib ui-toolbar -p=ui
npx ng g lib google
```

# Setup of Modules and Components in the Main App

Here we are going to setup the Projects Module and component with routing enabled. Didn't actually keep this in but this is an example.

```bash
npx ng g m projects --routing
npx ng g c projects
```

# Generate Components for a Library

An example project library was added above called google, we are now going to add some components:

```bash
npx ng g s datastore/datastore --project=google
npx ng g s calendar/calendar --project=google
```

# Running Projects Locally

```bash
ng serve api
```

```bash
ng serve meet-app
```

### Running i18n Extraction and Merge

Run `npm install -g ngx-i18nsupport` to install the necessary packages.  
Then run `npm run extract-merge` to automatically extract new information and merge it into the previous translation file.
